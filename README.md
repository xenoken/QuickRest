# QuickRest

The Simplest and quickest way to create and send REST Requests.

## Getting Started

QuickRest is designed to help build a rest request in the fastest way possible.
As an example, here is the most basic rest request achievable with quickrest:
```
using QuickRest
Request r = new Request("http://www.ExampleWebsite.com");
r.Send();
```
and that's it!

## Notes
  - By default QuickRest uses GET as the method of the request.
